This extension may be useful if you have a local library of PC Windows games, such as Abandonware or public domain games not available on the usual platforms (steam, epic, xbox game pass, etc), and you have limited space on your fast storage device(s).  This extension allows you to host your games on big-and-slow storage devices (HDDs, network drives/NAS, etc.), and it can create & mangage game caches on your fast storage device(s) for the games you are actively playing. 

### Games must meet the following requirements to be eligible for game caching:
- Are locally installed (added via Add Game ‚Üí Manually or Scan Automatically)
- Are playable from the installation directory (i.e. not archived).
- Are listed under the 'Playnite' library.
- Have a single Play Action (see Game Details ‚Üí Actions).
- Platform is 'PC (Windows)'.
- Have no Roms.

### How it works

When you enable a game for caching, it gets subsumed under the NowPlaying Game Cacher library. (If game caching is later disabled, the game is released back to the Playnite library.)

To play a game from the NowPlaying library, you first ***Install*** it to create a game cache on your fast storage device, and then you ***Play*** it as you normally would.  As an alternative, you can also ***Preview*** the game (via route-mouse click) without creating a cache. Preview plays a game directly from its installation directory, aka, from a big-and-slow storage device.  Once you finish a game, or if don't plan on playing it for awhile, you'll likely want to ***Uninstall*** it to delete its cache and free up space for other game caches.

While a game's cache is being created (which can take awhile depending on the size of the game, speed of the storage devices, etc), you are still able to browse and play games in Playnite; and you can also schedule cache installation for additional games (in a queue).  Depending on NowPlaying's settings, cache installation can continue in the background while you are playing games.

Playnite's built in interface can be used for basic game cache management (install/uninstall, as well as enable/disable game caching via right-mouse).  More advanced management is available from the NowPlaying Game Cacher view (via the sidebar). NowPlaying's settings are also accessible there, too.

#### Changes made to a Playnite Game when caching is enabled:
- Install Directory ‚Üí points to the game's cache directory, under a NowPlaying cache root directory/device (i.e. on a fast storage device)  
- Plugin ID ‚Üí NowPlaying Game Cacher's ID (will be listed under the NowPlaying Game Cacher library)
- Game Actions: original Play action is replaced by NowPlaying Play (play from cache) and Preview (play from original install directory) actions.

#### Changes made to a Playnite Game when caching is disabled:
- Install Directory ‚Üí points back to the game's installation directory (i.e. on a big-and-slow storage device)  
- Plugin ID ‚Üí 'empty' ID (will be listed under the Playnite library)
- Game Actions: the game's original Play action is restored.

### Initial setup: choose a cache root
After installing this extension, you'll want to specify at least one cache root directory/storage device and then you'll be able to enable games for caching.  This is done from the NowPlaying Game Cacher view (via sidebar). 

- Choose a new, empty ***Directory*** on a fast storage device to create game caches in, such as "C:\Games\NowPlaying".  Note, you can specify multiple cache roots but only one is allowed per storage device.

- Set the ***Maximum fill level*** allowed for the storage device when installing game caches, in a range of 50-100%.  This will limit the space used for game caches on the device and reserve a portion of it for other use.  It's recommended to set the maximum fill level to, at most, 75-85% (or so) for a cache root on your system disk (C:).  If the device is used exclusively for gaming, it can be set as high as 100%.


### A few notes about cache installation
- At most one active game cache installation can occur at a time.  Any additional game cache install requests are queued up if there is already an active install underway.
- An active cache installation can be paused or cancelled, and queued installations can be cancelled (via right-mouse menu).  Game caches in a paused state can be resumed (or uninstalled) at a later time.
- Cache installation is automatically paused if the maximum fill level of the cache root device is exceeded (or if the device becomes 100% full).  You will need to free up some space on the device (or increase the maximum fill level setting of the cache root via the edit button) before the cache installation can be resumed.
- If you launch a Playnite game, your active/queued cache intallations can continue in the background, as normal, but you also have the option of pausing all installations or shifting them to a speed limited mode while you are actively playing games.  (See NowPlaying Settings.)  Paused or speed limited cache installations will automatically be resumed (at full speed) once you are done playing.

### Uninstalling 'dirty' game caches
Some games save settings and game save data locally. 
While playing one of these games, the cache can become 'dirty', or different than the installed files.
When a dirty game cache is uninstalled, you have the option of syncing updated game settings/save data back
to the installation directory. (See NowPlaying settings.)

### Example use case:

1. Import PC Windows games into Playnite from your big-and-slow storage devices (Add Game ‚Üí Manually, or Add Game ‚Üí Scan Automatically)

    ***Make sure each game's Installation Folder points to its main folder. Also, avoid using a shortcut (with a hardcoded path to the big-and-slow device) as the game's executable*** 
    
    A good way to check this at a glance is to see if the Install Size seems reasonable. Sometimes Playnite sets the Installation Folder to a subdirectory where the game executable lives.  When that happens, the Install Size reported will be way too small.  Edit the game's Install Folder and Play action path, if needed.

    #### Incorrect üòíüö´

    - Installation Folder:  E:\Games\My Favorite Abandonware Game\Some subdirectory\bin
    - Install Size: 50 KB
    - Play action, Path:  {InstallDir}\MyFaveAbondonwareGame.exe

    #### Correct üòÅüëç

    - Installation Folder:  E:\Games\My Favorite Abandonware Game
    - Install Size: 5 GB
    - Play action, Path:  {InstallDir}\Some subdirectory\bin\MyFaveAbondonwareGame.exe


2. Install NowPlaying Game Cacher Extension, if you haven't already.
3. Navagate to the NowPlaying Game Cacher view (via sidebar).
4. Add at least one NowPLaying Cache Root (storage device, directory, max fill level), where game caches can be created.

   **Note, a maximum fill level can be set to prevent game caches from completely filling your storage device, if necessary.
   Definitely set this < 100% if using your C:\ drive for game caches, for example.**


5. Enable caching for the games you imported in step 1.  If you specified more than one Cache Root, you will be able to select which Root each game will be cached to, in this step.  There are two ways to enable games for caching:

    - From the NowPlaying Game Cacher view (via sidebar), click on the "+" under the NowPlaying Game Caches list. In the popup,
    filter/select from the list of cache-eligible games.
    - From Playnite's main (Library) view, right click on a game that is eligible for game caching, select "NowPlaying: Enable caching for selected game", and select a cache root if multiple cache roots are defined. 


6. Installing/uninstalling a game cache; there are several ways:

    - Use Playnite's built-in install/uninstall mechanisms for your cache enabled games (those listed under the NowPlaying Game Cacher library).
    - From the NowPlaying Game Cacher view (via sidebar), use install/uninstall buttons or right-mouse options to manage your game caches.
